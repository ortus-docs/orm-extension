# Introduction

## Ortus Redis Extension v2.x Docs

The [Ortus Redis Extension](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/redis-lucee) is a **native** Lucee Extension that allows your CFML server to connect to a Redis server or a Redis Cluster and leverage it for built-in caching, session storage, Pub/Sub Messaging, and document storage.

> Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperlogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.
