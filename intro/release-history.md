# Release History
## 6.1.0 - 2023-07-11

### üí• Removed

* Dropped the public  method from the Dialect class. This method was unused (to my knowledge) and unnecessary.

### üîê Security

- Switched to [Snyk vulnerability scanner](https://github.com/snyk/actions/tree/master/maven-3-jdk-11) to limit false positives. Security vulnerabilities will now be published on the [GitHub repository's Security Advisories page](https://github.com/Ortus-Solutions/extension-hibernate/security/advisories).

## [6.0.0] - 2023-07-01

### ‚≠ê Added

#### Second-Level Caching

The extension will now throw an error if you try to configure an unsupported cache provider like , , etc. Previously, the extension would silently switch to ehcache if any cache provider besides EHCache was configured.

#### Hibernate Logging

This version re-enables Hibernate logging via SLF4j and LogBack. Hibernate root and cache loggers are defaulted to  level, while SQL logging is set to  if  is enabled. (Set to .)

#### OWASP Dependency CVE Scans

The extension [GitHub Release page](https://github.com/Ortus-Solutions/extension-hibernate/releases/latest) now generates a dependency CVE report via [Jeremy Long's OWASP dependency-check maven plugin](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/index.html). Any known CVEs contained in dependencies ( excluding  and -scoped dependencies) will be noted in [each release's CVE report artifact](https://github.com/Ortus-Solutions/extension-hibernate/releases/download/latest/owasp-cve-report.html).

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed

#### New Repo Layout

-   Java source moved to 
-   All java classes are now under the  package
-   Dropped the java source format-on-push in favor of format-on-save IDE tooling

#### New Test Layout

-   Internal tests rewritten to native Testbox specs
-   Cloned all ORM tests from the Lucee repository
-   Updated to TestBox 5.0

#### New Build (and .jar file) Layout

We re-architected the build to inline most dependencies. I.e. we no longer copy in extension dependencies as (custom-built) OSGI bundles, but instead as compiled classes.

-   This resolves intermittent issues with bundle resolution and/or duplicate bundle collision upon installing the ORM extension into a Lucee server prior to uninstalling the Lucee Hibernate extension.
-   This also removes a number of direct dependencies on custom OSGI bundles, thus it is more reliable and will offer easier dependency upgrades with less pain.

#### Other

-   The  attribute is deprecated in Hibernate 5.x, and is no longer generated on HBM/XML mapping files to avoid Hibernate warning that Use of DOM4J entity-mode is considered deprecated.

### üêõFixed

-   The  definition file for all built-ins was missed during the conversion to a Maven build. (Since [v5.4.29.25](https://github.com/Ortus-Solutions/extension-hibernate/releases/tag/v5.4.29.25)). This caused the  and  built-in method calls to be picked up by Lucee core before being routed to this extension. No known errors resulted from this mistake, but we feel embarrassed anyway. üòÖ
-   Clear ORM context data once per ORM reload, not once per ORM entity parsing. This should improve ORM startup/reload time and avoid difficult session or cache manager lifecycle issues.

## [5.4.29.28] - 2023-06-07

### üêõ Fixed

We now set the JAXB  system property based on the JRE version. If less than JRE 11, we set . If JRE 11 or greater, we set .

This prevents the following warning from being logged on each ORM method call:

    WARNING: Using non-standard property: javax.xml.bind.context.factory. Property javax.xml.bind.JAXBContextFactory should be used instead.

See [OOE-3](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/OOE-3).

## [5.4.29.27] - 2023-05-29

### üêõ Fixed

-   We now set a  System property to ensure the JAXB API can find its implementation in CommandBox environments. This may trigger a log message, but shouldn't cause any concern. Vanilla Tomcat installations _may_ need to overwrite or clear this property. [LDEV-4276](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/)

## [5.4.29.26] - 2023-05-24

### üêõ Fixed

-   Entity has no state when listener method (, for example) is fired ([014814263b5d31b8bac4c17479c2ca731ceb4e7c](https://github.com/Ortus-Solutions/extension-hibernate/commit/014814263b5d31b8bac4c17479c2ca731ceb4e7c), [OOE-1](https://ortussolutions.atlassian.net/browse/OOE-1))

## [5.4.29.24] - 2023-05-17

### üîê Security

-   Upgraded dom4j library from 1.6.1 to 2.1.4. This removes [two potential vulnerabilities](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/dom4j/dom4j/1.6.1) in dom4j's XML parsing capabilities.

## [5.4.29.23] - 2023-05-15

-   Adds javadocs auto-published to [apidocs.ortussolutions.com](https://apidocs.ortussolutions.com/#/lucee/hibernate-extension/)

### üêõ Fixed

-   ORM events not firing ([LDEV-4308](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-4308))
-   Session close on transaction end ([LDEV-4017](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-4017))
-   length not used on varchar fields ([LDEV-4150](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-4150))

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed

-   Dramatic improvements in initialization performance
